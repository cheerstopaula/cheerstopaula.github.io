I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu). I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/), and my research interests include Algorithmic Fairness and Mechanism Design. 

Prior to joining UMass, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), were I worked as adjunct faculty, and worked on tsunami forecasting as a researcher at [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/).
