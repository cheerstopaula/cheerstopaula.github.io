I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu), advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/) and conducting research at the [Fair and Explainable Decision Making (FED) lab](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/people.html). My research focuses on the course allocation and chore division problems. My research interests include Fair Division, Algorithm design and implementation. 

Prior to joining UMass, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), where I also worked as adjunct faculty.  Later, I spent two years as a researcher [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/).

More recently, I was a Summer 2024 [Data Science for the Common Good](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/programs/ds4cg/ds4cg-team) reserch fellow, at the UMass Amherst Center for Data Science.
