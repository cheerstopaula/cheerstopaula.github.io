I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu). I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/) and research at the [Fair and Explainable Decision Making (FED) lab](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/people.html). My research interests include Algorithmic Fairness, Fair Allocation and Mechanism Design. 

Prior to joining UMass, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), where I worked as adjunct faculty. I also worked for two years at [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/) as a researcher. 

As of Summer 2024, I am interning at the UMass Amherst Center for Data Science, in the [Data Science for the Common Good](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/programs/ds4cg/ds4cg-team) program.
