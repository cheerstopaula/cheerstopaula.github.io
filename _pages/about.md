I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu), advised by professor [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/) and conducting research at the [Fair and Explainable Decision Making (FED) lab](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/people.html). My research areas are Fair Division, Combinatorial Optimization, and Interpretable and Scalable Algorithm Design. I am currently working on the course allocation and chore division problems.

Prior to joining UMass, I received my BS and MS in Mathematical Engineering at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/), where I was advised by [Rodrigo Cienfuegos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Twh1PxcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) during my MS. Later, I served as adjunct faculty at the same university, and worked as a researcher at [CIGIDEN](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/).

More recently, I was a Summer 2024 [Data Science for the Common Good](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/programs/ds4cg/ds4cg-team) reserch fellow, at the UMass Amherst Center for Data Science.

As of Spring 2025, I am visiting associate professor [Ayumi Igarashi](https://sites.google.com/site/eigarashayumi/home) at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo.
