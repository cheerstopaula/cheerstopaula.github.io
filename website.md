## about
### 

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/index.html) and research at the Fair and Explainable Decision Making (FED) lab. 

My research interests include combinatorial optimization, algorithmic design, analysis, and implementation, and I'm currently working on fair division problems, such as course allocation, chore division, and food donation assignment.

I am interested in brigding the gap between theory and practice, to solve real world problems. If you want to chat, feel free to contact me using the links in the footer.
