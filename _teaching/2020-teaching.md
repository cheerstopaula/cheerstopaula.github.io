This course aims to equip students with the skills to analyze systems operating under uncertainty and develop models to quantitatively evaluate the consequences of different design and operational alternatives. It also introduces discrete simulation modeling. The course emphasizes practical applications through examples and aims to build a solid foundation in stochastic modeling and simulation for industrial engineering students. The contents on this course include Poisson processes, renewal processes, discrete and continuous time Markov Chains, queueing systems and theory, and discrete system simulation.
